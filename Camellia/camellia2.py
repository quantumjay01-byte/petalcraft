Camellia blooms mainly during winter and early spring.

The flowers have a neat, layered petal structure.

The plant grows best in cool, shaded environments.

Camellias prefer well-drained, slightly acidic soil.

They are commonly grown in gardens, parks, and as ornamental shrubs.

Camellia flowers symbolize love, admiration, beauty, and perfection.

The plant is native to East Asia, especially China and Japan.

Some camellia species are used to produce tea and tea seed oil.
